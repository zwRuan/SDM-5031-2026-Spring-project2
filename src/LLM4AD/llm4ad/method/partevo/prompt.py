### Instructions
Please design your new algorithm by following these exact steps:

Step 1 -- Propose a Novel Algorithmic Concept
- Clearly describe the core mechanism of your new algorithm.
- Focus on the fundamental reasoning principle.
- Keep it concise but precise.
- Wrap the description EXACTLY inside:
<concept>
...
</concept>

Step 2 — Implement the Algorithm  
- Implement your proposed algorithm using the exact Python function template provided below:
```python
{str(temp_func)}
```
- Do NOT modify the function name, arguments, or return type.
- Place all necessary `import` statements inside the function body.

Please take **Algorithm #1 as the primary algorithm** and critically analyze the concepts and code of the Auxiliary Algorithm(s). 
Identify their strengths and creatively incorporate those advantageous characteristics into the primary one to design a new, superior algorithm.
Importantly, you must modify and upgrade the primary algorithm; superficial refactoring, or simple reweighting is NOT allowed.

Please design your new algorithm by following these exact steps:

Step 1 -- Propose a New Algorithmic Concept
- Clearly describe the core mechanism of your algorithm.
- Focus on the fundamental reasoning principle.
- Keep it concise but precise.
- Wrap the description EXACTLY inside:
<concept>
...
</concept>

Step 2 — Implement the Algorithm  
- Implement your proposed algorithm using the exact Python function template provided below:
```python
{str(temp_func)}
```
- Do NOT modify the function name, arguments, or return type.
- Place all necessary `import` statements inside the function body.
